                        <p>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</p>
                    
                        <p>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</p>
                    
                        <p>And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>
                    
                        <p>Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>
                    
                        <p>And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon.</p>
                    
                        <p>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was] sporting with Rebekah his wife.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she [is] thy wife: and how saidst thou, She [is] my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Abimelech charged all [his] people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>
                    
                        <p>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</p>
                    
                        <p>And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</p>
                    
                        <p>For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</p>
                    
                        <p>For all the wells which his father&#39;s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Isaac&#39;s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</p>
                    
                        <p>And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac&#39;s herdmen, saying, The water [is] our&#39;s: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</p>
                    
                        <p>And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</p>
                    
                        <p>And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</p>
                    
                        <p>And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.</p>
                    
                        <p>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham&#39;s sake.</p>
