                <h3>The two Marys</h3>
                
                    <h4>Matthew 28:1 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</p>
                    
                
            
                <h3>Mary Magdalene</h3>
                
                    <h4>Mark 16:9 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+16&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>
                    
                
                    <h4>John 20:11-14 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+20&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, [and looked] into the sepulchre,</p>
                    
                        <p>And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</p>
                    
                        <p>And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</p>
                    
                        <p>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
                    
                
            
                <h3>Cleopas and another</h3>
                
                    <h4>Luke 24:13-31 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+24&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs.</p>
                    
                        <p>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
                    
                        <p>And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
                    
                        <p>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>
                    
                        <p>And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are] these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>
                    
                        <p>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>
                    
                        <p>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</p>
                    
                        <p>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>
                    
                        <p>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
                    
                        <p>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</p>
                    
                        <p>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
                    
                        <p>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
                    
                        <p>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</p>
                    
                        <p>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>
                    
                        <p>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
                    
                        <p>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p>
                    
                        <p>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>
                    
                        <p>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and brake, and gave to them.</p>
                    
                        <p>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
                    
                
            
                <h3>Cephas</h3>
                
                    <h4>1 Corinthians 15:4-5 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1 corinthians+15&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>
                    
                        <p>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</p>
