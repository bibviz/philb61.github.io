                <h3>At the beginning of his ministry</h3>
                
                    <h4>John 2:11-16 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+2&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
                    
                        <p>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</p>
                    
                        <p>And the Jews&#39; passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</p>
                    
                        <p>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>
                    
                        <p>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers&#39; money, and overthrew the tables;</p>
                    
                        <p>And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father&#39;s house an house of merchandise.</p>
                    
                
            
                <h3>The day of his trimphal entry</h3>
                
                    <h4>Luke 19:36-45 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+19&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</p>
                    
                        <p>And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</p>
                    
                        <p>Saying, Blessed [be] the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p>
                    
                        <p>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p>
                    
                        <p>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</p>
                    
                        <p>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</p>
                    
                        <p>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things [which belong] unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
                    
                        <p>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</p>
                    
                        <p>And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p>
                    
                        <p>And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</p>
                    
                
            
                <h3>The day after his triumphal entry</h3>
                
                    <h4>Matthew 21:1-13 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+21&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</p>
                    
                        <p>Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose [them], and bring [them] unto me.</p>
                    
                        <p>And if any [man] say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>
                    
                        <p>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,</p>
                    
                        <p>Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.</p>
                    
                        <p>And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</p>
                    
                        <p>And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set [him] thereon.</p>
                    
                        <p>And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed [them] in the way.</p>
                    
                        <p>And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</p>
                    
                        <p>And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</p>
                    
                        <p>And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</p>
                    
                        <p>And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
                    
                
                    <h4>Mark 11:1-17 <a class="btn btn-small context" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+11&amp;amp;version=AKJV;NIV;NLT"><i class="icon-book"></i> <span class="label">View context</span></a></h4>
                    
                        <p>And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,</p>
                    
                        <p>And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring [him].</p>
                    
                        <p>And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.</p>
                    
                        <p>And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</p>
                    
                        <p>And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</p>
                    
                        <p>And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.</p>
                    
                        <p>And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.</p>
                    
                        <p>And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed [them] in the way.</p>
                    
                        <p>And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</p>
                    
                        <p>Blessed [be] the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</p>
                    
                        <p>And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</p>
                    
                        <p>And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</p>
                    
                        <p>And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not [yet].</p>
                    
                        <p>And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard [it].</p>
                    
                        <p>And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</p>
                    
                        <p>And would not suffer that any man should carry [any] vessel through the temple.</p>
                    
                        <p>And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
